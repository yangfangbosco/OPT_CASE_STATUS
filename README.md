1. THis is a maven project, so you should have maven installed or use eclipse with maven plug-in(prefered).
2. Simply change the "start" and "end" variable in Driver.java.
3. Also change the line System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "/Users/--/Downloads/chromedriver"); to the path of the chormedriver.
4. Then you can run the Driver.java.

If it doesn't work. Simply create a new maven project in your eclipse, copy Driver.java and pom.xml(You might need make slightly change to fit your project group id, etc), then run the Driver.java
